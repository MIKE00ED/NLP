        "BERT (introduced in this paper) stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. If you don’t know what most of that means - you’ve come to the right place! Let’s unpack the main ideas:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Bidirectional - to understand the text you’re looking you’ll have to look back (at the previous words) and forward (at the next words)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Transformers - The Attention Is All You Need paper presented the Transformer model. The Transformer reads entire sequences of tokens at once. In a sense, the model is non-directional, while LSTMs read sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left). The attention mechanism allows for learning contextual relations between words (e.g. his in a sentence refers to Jim).\n",
        "\n",
        "- (Pre-trained) contextualized word embeddings - The ELMO paper introduced a way to encode words based on their meaning/context. Nails has multiple meanings - fingernails and metal nails.\n",
        "BERT was trained by masking 15% of the tokens with the goal to guess them. An additional objective was to predict the next sentence. Let’s look at examples of these tasks:\n",

        "Masked Language Modeling (Masked LM)\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this task is to guess the masked tokens. Let’s look at an example, and try to not make it harder than it has to be:\n",

        "\n",
        "**Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a pair of two sentences, the task is to say whether or not the second follows the first (binary classification). Let’s continue with the example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Input = [CLS] That’s [mask] she [mask]. [SEP] Hahaha, nice! [SEP]\n",

        "\n",
        "The training corpus was comprised of two entries: Toronto Book Corpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words). While the original Transformer has an encoder (for reading the input) and a decoder (that makes the prediction), BERT uses only the decoder.\n",
